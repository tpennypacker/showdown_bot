Pokemon Showdown toolbot, built by Trevor Pennypacker / Fespy



SETUP:
0. Move this folder to an easily accessible place (I put mine in my Documents folder)
1. Install python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (NOTE: when the installer opens, make sure to check off the "add to path" option at the bottom)
2. Open the Command Prompt
3. Install the python websockets library by typing "pip install websockets" and pressing enter (without the quotation marks)
4. Install the python requests library by typing "pip install requests" and pressing enter
5. Open bot_settings and enter your preferences. Make sure to save your changes.





HOW TO USE:
1. Open the Command Prompt
2. Type "python <relative path to folder>/pokebot/main.py" and press enter
	(if you put this folder inside your Documents folder, the command would be "python Documents/pokebot/main.py")
3. When you're finished, just close out of the Command Prompt, and the bot will stop running.


Note: the bot will work regardless of whether you start it before or after logging into Showdown on your browser.
Note: if you make changes to bot_settings while the bot is running, you will have to restart the bot before the changes take effect.
