Kinda should make sure everything rounded for damages/hps currently do in state heuristic might be okay but still idk couldn't find problem
maybe round all hps to int?
possibly reduce value of KO? since should prioritise in some form to reduce damage taken anyways
had exca using rock slide vs rotom/tar, look into
print move combinations, id/moveid as well as score
because moves getting redirected on ko, doesn't care about target of 2nd move, will be fixed when add protect or order moves individually first?
discard moves like eq/surf that hit partner if damage on them is greater than say 10% (or even if just not immune/protecting)
also only have strongest spread move, or at least discard ones that do less damage to both foes compared to another move?
have try except with move decisions stuff inside so don't break if problem?
have log file all messages are logged to and overwrite on each run
make sure not adding options to hit dead foe
if two moves with equal evaluation, choose the one targeting different slots? makes better against protect in that case
if one spread then use one that koes the other foe (more complicated), if first move koes already then idk


add fake out stuff, considering only against not inner focus or ghost, only when can use, add flinch counter on pokemon and make reset at end of turn, also to ignore moves for flinched pokemon
add pixelate, also strong jaw/iron fist etc for some basic abilities
make knock out work with getting boost at least
add consideration for focus sash when dealing damage


fishious rend, dragon darts, eruption, dragon darts, phantom force, follow me/rage powder, status moves, taunt/encore/disable, substitute
half damage against dmax
for dmaxed pokemon use max moves


when evaluating moves from one side (against null move), could cut off moves say 100 lower than best? ignoring fake out/status/switch
could maybe just ignore spread moves hitting everything for now since rarely good and does add an extra second or so, in better case only consider in certain cases or have lower priority in list
